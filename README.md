# Raptor Run

Raptor Run is a single-player game developed as part of an EE2026 project. The game is built for an FPGA board with an OLED display connected to the JC PMOD port. Players control a dinosaur character that must navigate obstacles by jumping, ducking, and moving forward or backward. The game features four levels of increasing difficulty, each with progressively faster obstacle speeds.

## Game Controls

The game includes the following controls:
- **BTNU (Up)**: Makes the dinosaur jump. Press twice quickly to perform a double jump.

## Gameplay

### Main Menu

### Obstacles
The obstacles, including different types of cacti and birds, appear randomly and scroll across the screen. Each level speeds up the obstacles, making the game more challenging. Collision with an obstacle triggers the Game Over screen.

### Game Over
When you collide with an obstacle:
- The OLED display shows a Game Over screen with an animated dinosaur breathing fire.
- The 7-segment display shows "OVER."
- You can press any button to return to the main menu and start a new game.
